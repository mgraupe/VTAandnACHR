### Objective of the Course 

The field of neuroscience is becoming more and more quantitative and this development is accompanied by
of an ever-increasing stream of data derived from the brain. It is essential that this development
is performed by neuroscientists who are ready and able to process this data. Data science is an emerging field
dedicated to understanding principles in data sets. This teaching unit aims to introduce the
principles data science applied to neural data.


Concretely, *Neural Data Science with Python* aims to teach how to handle, analyze, visualize neural data, to create models and to run simulations of neural systems
using the Python programming language. The students will be acquire to use different general and specific Python libraries
such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, brian and the use of the Jupyter Notebook environment.
